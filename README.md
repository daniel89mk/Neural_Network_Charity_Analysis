# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
Need to help this foundation predict where to make investments. I will use features in the dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. 


## Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

- Data Preprocessing
  - What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' - that predicts if applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup Business.
  - What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model? 
    - 'NAME' that will be binned, considered as not feature.
'APPLICATION_TYPE' that will be binned
'AFFILIATION'
'CLASSIFICATION'that will be binned
'USE_CASE'
'ORGANIZATION' that will be considered as not feature.
'INCOME_AMT'
'ASK_AMT' that will be considered to bin.
  - What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

- Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
  - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  - What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
